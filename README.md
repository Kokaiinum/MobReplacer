# MobReplacer
A plugin for Koikatu that allows you to replace the default generic characters that appear in story cutscenes with characters of your choosing.
Uses a decent amount of code from [CharacterReplacer](https://github.com/IllusionMods/CharacterReplacer) but I split this to a separate plugin to avoid bloating the options list for the original.

## Usage
Select the characters you want to replace in the F1 plugins menu. These characters have no official names so they are referred to by their internal asset names. Sorry about that  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
